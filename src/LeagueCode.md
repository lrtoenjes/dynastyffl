<a name="Introduction">
# 1.0 Introduction

Welcome to the _League Name Pending_ League! This is a dynasty league started in May 2019. It’s made up of close friends, siblings, acquaintances and soon-to-be-rivals, where the intent is be competitive not only through the NFL regular season, but also through the offseason. If you’re new to a dynasty league, it’s like a keeper league in that you keep players each year, only now, you’re keeping your entire roster from season to season. It looks to emulate that of being an NFL GM where your moves from every season impact your team for years to come.

<a name="Administration">
## 1.1 Administration

<a name="League-Dues">
### 1.1.1 League Dues and Distribution of Winnings

The league managers will determine prior to the beginning of the NFL preseason each year the “buy-in” amount for the managers, and the breakdown of distribution of the dues to league winner(s) at year end. Once determined by unanimous agreement, the dues will be added as an annual addendum to the League Code.

<a name="League-Trophy">
### 1.1.2 League Trophy

Fantasy Football trophies range in cost from $40 USD to $150 USD. If the league collectively agrees to have a trophy, then the cost of the trophy will be evenly divided amongst all of the managers. This cost would obviously be a one-time fee in the inaugural season.

<a name="Manager-Expectations">
## 2.2 Manager Expectations

It is expected that all managers do their best to stay engaged in the league. This helps to ensure a culture of competitiveness amongst the league members. Since this is a dynasty league, managers are strongly encouraged to stay active all year long, and not just through the NFL regular season. Staying active and engaging with other managers in the league will make the league more fun, which is what Fantasy Football is all about.

<a name="Co-Owners">
## 2.3 Co-Owners

The Sleeper platform allows a team to be managed by two different managers. This is useful for if you are initially were very active in the league, but now have other commitments in life, yet still wish to stay in the league. In the co-owner system, both owners have equal rights to managing the team meaning that there is less commitment for each co-owner. You MUST inform the commissioner of the league if you wish to enable co-owner access for you team.

In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, a manager may not appoint the manager of another team in the league as a co-owner. All co-owners must be individuals who are not already involved in the league.

----------

<a name="Rules">
# 3.0 Rules

<a name="Platform">
## 3.1 Platform

This league will be using the Sleeper app as its platform of choice. This app is free, contains no ads, and is centered around a league group chat system which provides an immersive fantasy experience. It’s also highly customizable for dynasty leagues, which is the main reason why it was chosen as this league’s platform.

-------

<a name="Settings">
## 3.2 Settings

<a name="Scoring">
### 3.2.1 Scoring

This league will be a 0.5 Points Per Reception (HPPR) league. HPPR scoring settings work better for dynasty leagues with large roster sizes because RBs typically have a shorter lifespan but produce more points whereas WRs have a longer lifespan but produce fewer points. Full scoring settings will be available to be viewed within the league homepage on the Sleeper platform.

Scoring settings will locked once the season begins and cannot be changed until the end of league playoffs. Scoring settings may be adjusted in the offseason for the subsequent year with the unanimous approval of league managers.

<a name="Roster-Size">
### 3.2.2 Roster Size


Because this is a dynasty league, which involves keeping an entire roster from year to year, the total number of roster positions will be as follows:

| Teams          | Starting Positions      | Bench Positions  | Taxi Squad* | Total     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------------- | --------------     |
| 12   | 9   | 16         |          5            |  30 + 2 IR  |

*Note: see [Taxi Squads](#Taxi-Squads) for more info

<a name="Starting-Roster">
### 3.2.3 Starting Rosters

Managers will set a starting roster each week of the fantasy season. Starting rosters will be broken down by position as follows:

| QB | RB | WR | TE | FLEX | BENCH | IR | TOTAL  |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | ---- | ----- | -- | -----  |
| 1  | 2  | 3  | 1  | 2    | 16    | 2  | 30 (32)|

<a name="Taxi-Squads">
### 3.2.4 Taxi Squads

Taxi Squads are a separate part of your total roster; that is, they do not count against your total roster spots. They are usually made up of players who you wish to take a flier on, but are not confident that they will play well in the current season. A manager may place a player in their Taxi Squad such that they retain their rights for multiple seasons without the player impacting their active roster numbers. 

Taxi squads may be used to shelter rookies that are drafted during the rookie draft but not promoted to a team’s main roster, or free agents acquired during the season. Teams may freely make transactions between their main roster and Taxi Squad prior to a pre-established deadline during the season. After the deadline passes, no free agent acquisitions may be added to a player’s Taxi Squad, and players promoted from the Taxi Squad to the main roster cannot be sent back to the Taxi Squad. As such, if promoting a Taxi Squad player to the main roster after the Taxi Squad deadline, managers must be prepared to drop a roster player to make room.

Players assigned to a Taxi Squad cannot have more than 2 years NFL experience. If a player who has more than 2 years experience, is on a Taxi Squad, that manager will be locked from making roster moves until he removes that player from the Taxi Squad.

-------

<a name="Roster-Management">
## 3.3 Roster Management

This is expected to be competitive league where all managers, regardless of their position in the standings, will do their best to stay engaged and active in the league. As a result, certain rules will be put in place to ensure competition week in and week out.

<a name="Starting-Roster-Requirements">
### 3.3.1 All Managers Must Start a FULL Roster

All managers are required to start a full roster every single week. This ensures fair competition for all teams and matchups. Managers are expected to update their rosters weekly to avoid starting an inactive player in cases where players have bye-week or known player injuries. Managers will not be penalized for starting a player listed as Questionable if the player does not end up starting the game. 

Certain cases, such as last-minute injuries, will occasionally lead to managers unintentionally starting a player who ends up being inactive for the week. A manager who unintentionally does not start a full roster due to unforeseen circumstances will not be penalized. Managers who intentionally field an incomplete roster, such as in cases where they wish to “tank” or do not wish to have to drop or add a player to start a full roster, may be subject to penalty. Given the depth of rosters in a dynasty league, the latter case is unlikely to be relevant in the League. 

In cases where a manager intentionally neglects to start a full lineup, they may be subject to penalty through draft pick forfeiture. Penalties for intentionally failing to start a full lineup will be determined based on the severity of the neglect (i.e. missing one player versus missing a full roster), and whether the manager shows a pattern of intentional neglect. League managers will determine through mutual agreement whether a penalty will be applied. If a penalty is applied, the penalty will be:

* Your team may forfeit all or part of the following draft picks in the Rookie/FA Draft
    * 3rd round pick
    * 5th round pick

-------

<a name="Draft">
## 3.4 Draft

<a name="Inaugural-Draft">
### 3.4.1 Inaugural Draft


This draft will take place only once and will be the league’s Inaugural Draft. It will take place between the end of the NFL Draft and the end of the 4th week of the NFL Preseason. The draft will be anywhere between 20 and 30 rounds. The Sleeper app gives the option to have draft turn time anywhere between 30 seconds to 24 hours. Draft date and turn time will be determined based off of unanimous vote.

* Inaugural Draft Date: June 8th, 2019, 7:30PM Mountain Time

<a name="Rookie-Draft">
### 3.4.2 Rookie Draft

The Rookie/Free Agent Draft will take place yearly, only after the NFL Draft has taken place. This draft will consist of multiple rounds to allow owners to restock their teams’ talent pool from the new players entering the NFL or through those Free Agents who are not yet on a fantasy team. Note: Free Agent means FA in our league, not exclusive to an FA in the actual NFL. The Rookie/Free Agent Draft is not a snake draft. That means the manager who picks first in the first round, will also pick first in the second round and so on.

-------

<a name="Trades">
## 3.5 Trades

This league is configured for a non-veto trade system. This means that trades, once accepted, will be instantaneous. Managers are all adults who can make their own decisions and own up to them. If the player that you just traded for, ends up tearing his ACL minutes after the trade, tough luck.

Collusion in trades will be dealt with appropriately; (see [3.8 Collusion](#Collusion)). If there’s a unanimous decision against a shady trade that has happened, the Commissioner has the power to reverse the trade. League managers will have 24 hours from when a trade is finalized to raise their concerns in the league chat. If all managers in the league agree that a trade is unacceptable, the league commissioner (at his discretion) will manually reverse the trade. 

It is important to note that this 24 hour period is **not** a formal veto period in which all managers must vote. All trades will take effect instantly, and team rosters will be updated instantly to swap the traded players and/or picks. Managers have no obligation to vote or comment on trades, however any concerns must be raised within 24 hours in order to be considered. The Sleeper app league chat conveniently has a polling system to accommodate any unofficial vote that is proposed.

Draft pick trading is allowed (and encouraged) all throughout the regular season and the offseason. Trading draft picks up until (and throughout) the inaugural draft, is also allowed as well as Rookie Draft draft picks. Draft pick trading does not have to involve an even number of picks going both ways. 

Finally, The Sleeper app supports 3-way and multi-way trading, allowing managers to construct a trade between multiple teams, adding more teams to the trade process as needed.


<a name="Trade-Deadline">
### 3.5.1 Trade Deadline

The trade deadline will be on Week 10 of the regular season. No trades may be made after the end of this week. The trading block will open up again in the NFL offseason after the SuperBowl is over.

-------

<a name="Waivers">
## 3.6 Waivers

Waivers in this league will run based off of the Free Agent Acquisition Budget format, or FAAB for short. In a waiver system that uses FAAB, there is no priority, instead managers bid on Free Agents, and the manager with the highest bid when waivers clear, will win the player. Each manager starts off with a preset, equal budget for the season. Once a manager has spent their FAAB, they cannot get more for the rest of the season or fantasy playoffs. Bids of $0 will be permitted in this leagues FAAB waiver system.

<a name="FAAB-Settings">
### 3.6.1 FAAB Settings

The starting FAAB amount for the Inaugural Season will be: **$200**. Every season thereafter, will have two separate FAAB budgets: one for the Offseason and one for the Season. Each of these will be the same: **$100**

<a name="Continuous-Waivers">
### 3.6.2 Continuous Waivers

On top of FAAB, this league will also feature a continuous waiver system, whereby waivers process every morning. This ensures fair claim to all players on waivers so we don’t end up with a Nick Chubb 2018 scenario.

* Waivers Process every morning at: 09:00 (Pacific Time)

-------

<a name="Offseason">
## 3.7 Offseason

The offseason starts as soon as the Superbowl for the current NFL season is over. That means that trading opens up again as managers begin their preparations for the upcoming Rookie Draft.

-------

<a name="Collusion">
## 3.8 Collusion

Collusion of any form, will not be tolerated in this league. If one or more managers are found to have colluded at some point throughout the year, the penalties will be up to the decision of the commissioner, with input from other managers not involved in the collusion. Examples of collusion are, when two managers agree to, say, trade players for a week during bye weeks, only to trade those same players back the next week. Another example would be if two managers agree to bench their players so that their teams tie, and that tie prevents a third team from making the playoffs. Penalties for collusion may include any subset of the following:

* Miscellaneous acts of public shaming
* A fine, payable to the league’s charity of choice
* Loss of Rookie Draft draft picks
* Stripped of a playoff spot
* Expulsion from the league
